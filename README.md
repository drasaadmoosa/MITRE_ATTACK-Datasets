The `Security Datasets` project is an open-source initiatve that contributes malicious and benign datasets, from different platforms, to the infosec community to expedite data analysis and threat research.

**Welcome to the Mordor Project!** üåã

Ever wanted to take a trip to Mordor without facing the wrath of Sauron? Now you can, digitally! Dive deep into pre-cooked security events whipped up by simulating naughty adversarial techniques. All served hot in easily digestible JSON files, with a side of PCAP files for that extra kick of context. Grouped neatly under platforms, adversary crews, tactics, and techniques, our data is inspired by the ever-reliable MITRE ATT&CK Framework. And guess what? We don‚Äôt just show you the evil bits, but also the shady entourage that surrounds it. All this for the gourmet analyst in you to cook up correlation magic, upping your detection game, and kicking false positives to the curb.

**Why Mordor?** üìñüçø
Yep, you guessed right! It‚Äôs the dark and mysterious land from the epic "The Lord of the Rings". The place where Sauron‚Äôs goons chilled. Here, we‚Äôve made it the hub of data born from "malicious" mischief. A fitting name, we think!

**Benefits** üèπ
1. **Dish out** open datasets for turbo-charged data analytics.
2. **Boost** adversary technique simulations, at warp speed.
3. **Empower** security wizards globally to spar with genuine data.
4. **Revamp** the testing & validation game of detection analytics; making it cooler, handier, modulier, and wallet-friendlier.
5. **Gift** data scientists the goldmine of labeled (and not-so-labeled) data for their genius research.
6. **Bridge** the gap, linking our datasets with other rad projects like Sigma, Atomic Red Team, Threat Hunter Playbook, and, of course, MITRE ATT&CK.
7. **Sprinkle** our datasets at social tech-fests, like Capture The Flags or hackathons, because teamwork makes the dream work.

# Goals

* Provide open portable datasets to expedite the development of data analytics. 
* Facilitate and expedite adversary techniques simulation.
* Allow security analysts around the world to test their skills with real data.
* Improve the testing and validation of detection analytics in an easier, practical, modular and more affordable way. 
* Enable data scientists to have labeled and unlabeled data for initial research and features development.
* Help the community map datasets to other open source projects such as Sigma, Atomic Red Team, Threat Hunter Playbook (Jupyter Notebooks) and MITRE ATT&CK.
* Provide datasets for other social/community events such as Capture The Flags (CTFs) or hackathons to encourage collaboration.
